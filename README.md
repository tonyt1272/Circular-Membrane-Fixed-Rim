# Circular-Membrane-Fixed-Rim:  This package contains 3 files.
1.  Bez_first_mnzeros.m -a function that generates a table containing zeros of the Bessel Function of the first kind order m out to 
n zeros.

2.  Circular_Membrane_Modes.m -plots the mode shape for modes (m,n) entered on lines 12 and 13 of the code.

3.  Circular_Membrane_Animation.m -an animation of the a thin membrane, fixed at the rim that is displaced at its center in the shape
of a gaussian.  The animation is generated by combining the individual modes to form the initial displacement, the modes are then 
advanced in time each by their own Eigen frequency.
